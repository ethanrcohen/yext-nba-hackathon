    "c_aboutMe": "I began my practice over a decade ago in an attempt to metabolize deep grief and to understand the human condition through my own. After countless hours of practice + self study I began to shed the protective layers of my personality. I found myself thinking less and feeling more. I know now that our true nature is to love and to move from a space of open hearted compassion. I aim to get students back to this simple truth.",
